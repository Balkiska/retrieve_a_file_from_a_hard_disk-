# File Reading Examples

This repository contains examples of how to read a file from the disk using two different programming languages: **Python** and **Rust**. These examples are designed to demonstrate basic file reading operations, including error handling for cases where the file does not exist.

## Python Example


### Description

The Python script `read_file.py` demonstrates how to check if a file exists and read its content. It uses the `os` module to ensure compatibility across different operating systems.

### Usage

To use the Python script, replace `yourfile.txt` with the actual path to your file. You can run the script using a Python interpreter:
```sh```

## Rust Example


### Description

The Rust program src/main.rs demonstrates performing file reading with proper error handling. It utilizes Rust's strong type system and error handling features.

### Usage

First, replace yourfile.txt with the path to your file. Compile and run the program with Cargo:
```cargo run```
